  bio: Hey! I'm a second year CS Major and I am one of your Co-Presidents of GITMAD! I'm truly excited to be able to help improve this club! Last semester, I was the Events Coordinator and I was able to set up many Android-related Tech Talks with big companies such as Microsoft, State Farm, Capital One, UPS, and more! I have many plans for this club, including improving the curriculum by making it less complicating, as well as many more Tech talks throughout the year (so make sure to bring your resumes). Join us if you want to start learning Android!

  bio: Hello, I am Akash, and I am a freshman at Georgia Institute of Technology. I have been coding since eighth grade, and it has always been my goal to impact those around me with technology and computer science. When I moved to the US initially in eighth grade from India, the relative "newness" of everything was astonishing and overwhelming, and something more stable and static like learning to code from home gave me a sense of purpose and a medium of connecting to other similar-minded individuals. And this is the energy that I have been leveraging ever since to build community-inspired software and products that helps and empowers people with computer science. I am excited to have been appointed as technical officer at GITMAD, and it is my absolute pleasure to have the opportunity to work with you and build some incredible apps!
